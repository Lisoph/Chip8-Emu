Chip8-Emu
=========

My Chip-8 Emulator. Works quite nicely.

Written in C++11 (possibly some C++14), feel free to join development!

## Features

* Can run any valid Chip-8 roms (.c8 files).
* Emulator can be hard reset.
* Working buzzer (audio) support.
* ... and many more features to come!

## Planned important features

* Somewhat working GUI (inside the emulator, software rendered).
* Strongly configurable (volume, keyboard mapping, foreground render color, etc.)
